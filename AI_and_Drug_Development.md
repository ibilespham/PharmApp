# AI and Drug Development

Thanks to the technological revolution of computer information technology and thanks to the accumulation of a large amount of data, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has achieved rapid development in the past decades. At present, the application of AI technology in the field of biomedicine mainly covers four sub-fields: drug research and development, medical imaging, auxiliary diagnosis and treatment, and genetic analysis.

According to a data report from Global Market Insight, drug development is the largest market segment of the global artificial intelligence medical market, with a market share of about 35%. There are five subdivision directions in the field of drug research and development aided by AI.

## High-throughput screening of compounds

Compound screening refers to the process of selecting compounds with higher activity for a specific target from a large number of compounds or new compounds through standardized experimental methods. However, it often takes a long time and cost to screen out compounds that meet the activity index from tens of thousands of compound molecules.

AI technology can extract a large number of key information about compounds, toxicity and effectiveness through the integration of existing compound database information, data extraction, and machine learning. It not only avoids the trial and error, to some extent, but also greatly improves the success rate of screening.

## Drug target identification

The key to modern new drug research and development is to find, determine and prepare drug targets. Targets refer to the binding sites of drugs in the body, including gene sites, receptors, enzymes, ion channels, nucleic acids and other biological macromolecules.

AI systems can learn from existing data resources in each design cycle. The principles are similar to human learning methods, but AI must be more efficient in identifying multiple subtle changes to balance drug efficacy, selectivity, and pharmacokinetics.

## Prediction of Drug Molecular Dynamics Index (ADMET)

ADMET includes the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity of drugs. ADMET prediction is a very important method in contemporary drug design and drug screening. In the past, research on the properties of drug ADMET often combined in vitro research technology with computer simulation and other methods to study the kinetic performance of drugs in vivo.

There are dozens of computer simulation software in the market, including ADMET Predicator, MOE, Discovery Studio and Shrodinger. This kind of software has been widely used in drug regulatory departments, pharmaceutical companies and research institutes both at home and abroad.

## Pathobiology research

Pathobiology is the science of studying the laws and mechanisms of the occurrence, development, and outcome of diseases. Pathobiology research is the basis of medical research and development. Its research content refers to the conversion of pathological images into high-fidelity, high-throughput mining data based on artificial intelligence, which is used to quantify pathological diagnosis and disease prognosis, and finally automatically generate pathological diagnosis reports. With the support of artificial intelligence technology, the research of pathomics is developing in the direction of more automation and precision, which is also conducive to making full use of existing medical resources, saving research costs, and promoting medical development.

## Discovery of new indications for drugs

New use of old drugs is currently a common way to find new drugs. Its implementation is to cross-study and match the drugs that have been exposed on the market and more than 10,000 targets on humans.

Relying on AI's powerful natural language processing capabilities and deep learning capabilities, extracting knowledge that can promote drug development and new verifiable hypotheses from the disorganized mass of information will bring exponential improvements to the speed of trials.

The application of AI in the drug redirection can eliminate the steps of target discovery and pharmacological effect evaluation, which is expected to reduce the cost of drug development to 300 million US dollars or less, and the development cycle will also be shortened to 6.5 years.

PharmApp is an AI-driven drug R&D company that has successively launched a number of drug discovery prototypes, from the early development stage (AI-driven drug synthesis, drug design, drug activity prediction) to the clinical research stage (AI-driven pharmacovigilance system, registration transaction system, clinical data programming system) and so on, covering a series of key nodes in the whole process of new drug research and development. Meanwhile, it also offers comprehensive solutions for medical Imaging and medical therapy and research systems.
